# Quantity Measurement App

### ✅ UC1

Implemented basic equality comparison for length measurements using value-based comparison (e.g., 12 inches = 1 foot).

### ✅ UC2

Added support for comparing different units of length by converting values to a common base unit before equality check.

### ✅ UC3

Introduced additional length units (inches, feet, yards, centimeters) with proper conversion factors.

### ✅ UC4

Implemented unit-to-unit conversion functionality allowing a quantity to be converted to any other compatible unit.

### ✅ UC5

Added addition operation for same-unit quantities while maintaining immutability.

### ✅ UC6

Extended addition to support different units by converting both operands to a common base unit before summation.

### ✅ UC7

Improved design by ensuring immutability, constructor validation, and proper overriding of equals() and hashCode().

### ✅ UC8

Enhanced system robustness with rounding precision handling and comprehensive unit conversion validation across all length combinations.
