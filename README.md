# Quantity Measurement App

### ✅ UC1

Implemented value-based equality comparison for Feet objects only, comparing measurements using overridden equals() and hashCode().

### ✅ UC2

Extended equality comparison to support both Feet and Inches, enabling cross-unit comparison (e.g., 12 inches = 1 foot).

### ✅ UC3

Enabled comparison between different length units by converting values to a common base unit before checking equality.

### ✅ UC4

Added support for multiple length units such as inches, feet, yards, and centimeters with defined conversion factors.

### ✅ UC5

Implemented unit conversion functionality to convert values between supported length units.

### ✅ UC6

Added addition functionality for quantities of the same unit while maintaining immutability.

### ✅ UC7

Enhanced addition to support different units by converting values to a common base unit before summation.

### ✅ UC8

Improved design by enforcing constructor validation, immutability, and correct implementation of equals() and hashCode().
